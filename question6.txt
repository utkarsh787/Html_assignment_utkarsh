Q6)What are IDs and classes in HTML, and how do they differ?
ID is unique and used for a single element.

A class can be used on multiple elements on the same page, meaning multiple elements can share the same class.
example :
<!-- ID example: -->
<div id="header">This is a unique header</div>

<!-- Class example: -->
<div class="content">This is content #1</div>
<div class="content">This is content #2</div>
