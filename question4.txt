Semantic HTML means using HTML elements that clearly describe their meaning and purpose in a web page. These elements improve readability, accessibility, and SEO.

For example, instead of using a <div> for a navigation bar, we use <nav>, which explicitly defines its role.
Semantic Elements	  
<header> → Defines the header section	
<nav> → Defines navigation links	
<section> → Groups related content	
<article> → Represents an independent article	


Non-Semantic Elements
<div> → Generic container
<span> → Inline container
<b> → Bold text (without meaning)
<i> → Italic text (without meaning)
