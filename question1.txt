Q1) What is HTML, and how is an HTML document structured?

HTML  is known as HyperText Markup Language.
it  is the standard language used to create web pages. It structures content using tags like <h1>, <p>, and <img>.
Basic Structure of an HTML Document:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>

    <!DOCTYPE html> → Declares the document type
    <html> → Root of the document
    <head> → Contains metadata (title, styles, etc.)
    <body> → Contains the visible content of the page
